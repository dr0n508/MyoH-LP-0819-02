        <p>Amino acids are the cellular building blocks of protein in your body and play a role, either directly or indirectly, in nearly every physiological function. Each amino acid serves multiple purposes and works in concert with other amino acids to build muscle, transport nutrients, prevent illness, and so much more.</p>

            <p class="text-center">Technically, the term amino acids refers to the general chemical class and consists of more than 300 individual compounds.</p>

            <p class="text-center">Out of the 300, there are 20 dietary amino acids that occur in proteins in the body. Eleven are non-essential, meaning your body can produce them on its own. The remaining nine are essential amino acids (EAAs), meaning they cannot be made by your body and must be obtained through diet.</p>

            <p class="text-center">The nine essential amino acids are histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, valine, and tryptophan.</p>

            <p class="text-center">The role of protein in food is not to provide our bodies with proteins directly, but to supply the amino acids from which the body can make its own proteins.</p>

            <p class="text-center">When proteins are digested or broken down, amino acids are left. When amino acids are connected together by peptide bonds they form a polypeptide, which is another word for protein. Muscle is the main reservoir of amino acids in the body and requires proteins to grow in mass.</p>

            <p class="text-center">When exercise was added to EAA supplementation, respondents

            <p class="text-center">When EAAs were provided at rest, the increase in

                BRANCHED CHAIN AMINO ACIDS (BCAAS)</h2>

            <p class="text-center">Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs) are a group of three Essential Amino Acids (EAAs): leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Hence, all BCAAs are EAAs, but not all EAAs are BCAAs. Leucine, isoleucine, and valine are called "branched chain" because they’re the only amino acids to have a chain that branches to the side.</p>

            <p class="text-center">While BCAAs are vital for energy production and muscle metabolism, BCAAs alone do not stimulate muscle protein synthesis. In fact, the few studies measuring the response to BCAAs have shown a decreased rate of muscle protein synthesis.1</p>

            <p class="text-center">This makes only using BCAAs somewhat like fielding a baseball team with only three players, leaving you little chance of winning the game.</p>

            <p class="text-center">Because the role of protein in food is not to provide our bodies with proteins directly, but to supply the amino acids from which the bodycan make its own proteins, when we eat foods that supply each essential amino acid in adequate amounts, our body supports protein synthesis. These are called “complete proteins”.</p>

            <p class="text-center">Complete proteins contain all nine EAAs in adequate amounts. Animal foods such as dairy products, eggs, meats, poultry, and seafood, and soy are complete protein sources.</p>

            <p class="text-center">Every protein in your body is in a constant state of breakdown and synthesis.
                The rates of protein breakdown and synthesis determines whether
                you are gaining protein (anabolism) or losing protein (catabolism).</p>

            <p class="text-center">Supplementing EAAs into your diet is proven to significantly improve
                muscle protein synthesis at any age, resulting in a stimulated anabolic response. That’s just another way of saying that your body will begin producing
                protein at a rate greater than it’s being broken down.</p>

            <p class="text-center">By eating sufficient essential amino acids through a balanced approach
                of food and MyoHealth products, the rate of protein synthesis can match
                or even exceed the rate of protein breakdown.</p>

            <p class="text-center">At that point, you have growth, strength, and restored vitality that leads
